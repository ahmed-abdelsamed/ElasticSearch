How to setup an Elasticsearch 8.x Cluster ? {https://blog.devgenius.io/how-to-setup-an-elasticsearch-8-x-cluster-end-to-end-practice-b26cc9fe5799}

1- ELasticsearch from version 8.X , auto configuration just change clustr name & node name

For each node, open the Elasticsearch configuration file under the elasticsearch-8.3.0-Node*/config folder and open the elasticsearch.yml

## Just change cluster name & node name

#give your cluster a name.
cluster.name: My_Cluster_Tutorial

#give your nodes a name (change node number from node to node).
node.name: "es-node-1"

#During the installation, Elasticsearch is auto-configured as a single node cluster.

# If RAM is large not change
#now before launching the first node , we’ll change the xms and xmx parameters on jvm.options file to 512mb instead of 4gb

$./elasticsearch.bat 

copy these lines and save them somewhere safe.

now go to your elasticsearch.yml file and you’ll notice multiple changes

#Generate Elasticsearch Cluster Enrollment Token

Node1$ ./elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s node

'copy code and save'

---------------------------------------
now open node 2 elasticsearch.yml file and edit the cluster and node names :

#give your cluster a name.
cluster.name: My_Cluster_Tutorial

#give your nodes a name (change node number from node to node).
node.name: “es-node-2”

Save and exit.

$./elasticsearch --enrollment-token “generated token above”

rebeat step on node3

---------------------------------
#and we are going to change this by editing the elasticsearch.yml file on every node


cluster.initial_master_nodes: ["es-node-1","es-node-2","es-node-3"] # on All nodes

discovery.seed_hosts: ["10.107.237.15:9300", "10.107.237.16:9300", "10.107.237.17:9300"] # on all nodes


## before restarting our node01 , we need to repurpose the node role
elasticsearch-node repurpose   # running on all nodes


#now restart your node01

#elasticsearch-node repurpose can be used to delete unwanted data from a node if it used to be a data node or a master-eligible node but has been repurposed not to have one or other of these roles.

you need to repeat the last steps on node 2 and node 3 like we did with node 1 and restart them one at a time.


## Check cluster
 https://10.107.237.15:9201/_cat/nodes?v 

 https://10.107.237.15:9201/_cat/health?v 

------------

# After all nodes are up  running

Next, comment the initial master configuration set during auto-configuration , and replace it with

cluster.initial_master_nodes: [“es-node-1”,”es-node-2",”es-node-3"]

on all the nodes
